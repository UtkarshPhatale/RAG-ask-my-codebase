"""
Failure diagnosis (Day 3).

Pure analysis, no LLM call yet -- that's Week 2 (self-healing re-discovery).
This module answers one question: "given a hard_failure run, why did every
configured locator strategy fail, and what's missing?"

Motivating finding (from real evidence, 2026-08-13 runs): both hard-failure
replays failed on a `click` step whose artifact only ever recorded `role` and
`text` strategies -- never `xpath` or `css`, even though replay/engine.py's
_resolve() fully supports all four kinds. Tracing into agent/discovery.py
confirms discovery simply never emits an xpath/css strategy today. So the
real root cause of these two failures isn't "the DOM changed" (classic
self-healing scenario) -- it's "discovery under-populated the strategy list,
so replay had nothing left to fall back to." Diagnosis needs to say that
plainly, not just report a stack trace.
